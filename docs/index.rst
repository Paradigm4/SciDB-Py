SciDB-Py Documentation
======================

.. warning::

    This documentation is for SciDB-Py **16.9.1**. This library has
    been released in `September 2017` and has been rewritten entirely
    from scratch. This version is **not compatible** with the previous
    versions of the library. The documentation for the previous
    versions is available at `SciDB-Py documentation (legacy)
    <http://scidb-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. GitHub pull
    requests are still accepted for the previous versions, but the
    code is not actively maintained.
